# Concept Development

## Idea
The idea behind **Secret String** is to create a game that utilizes and explores the basic concepts of error handling and unit based Test Driven Development.

**Secret String** is a text based riddle game. The idea is that the user will have to input the correct string in order to win the game with the lowest possible score. 

The user will be shown a titlepage, the rules of the game and then given a riddle with a hint below.
The user will then be prompted either input a string OR ask for another hint.

If the user asks for a hint, they will be given another and 50 points. If they input a string that is incorrect, they will be given 10 points and a corresponding "error" that will give a vague hint towards what it was expecting.

The idea is that the user can read these error messages to try and decipher information about how many words the string needs, the length of those words, what each word starts with and ends with, etc.

Being able to somehow keep track of high scores would be an interesting addition, but probably outside the basic scope of this project for now.
